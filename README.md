# Calcium_signal_processing

This upload is to complement the accepted manuscript entitled 'Direct Translation of Climbing Fiber Burst-Mediated Sensory Coding into Post-Synaptic Purkinje Cell Dendritic Calcium' (September, 2020) in eLife.
This code is simple matlab m file. It is meant to process the calcium signals generated by Suite2p analysis, while signals from other software tools could be also used.
Basic function is to z-score normalize the signals, and obtain amplitudes and traces from the calcium event time (spontaneous responses) or other indicated times (air puff time). It also plots and compare spon vs Apuff responses.
Please be advised by the comments in the code and put appropriate modifications for your purpose. Thank you.
